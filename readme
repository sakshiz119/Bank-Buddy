Features:
- Integration with Google Palm text bison model using API key
- Connection to a MySQL database for storing and retrieving FAQ data
- SQLDatabaseChain in Langchain Experimental for seamless interaction between the language model and the database
- Streamlit for testing the chat bot in a user-friendly interface
